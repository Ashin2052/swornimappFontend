**This is a starting point for an Angular Universal application that can then be published correctly to heroku with working SSR(server side rendering)**

This starter was created by creating a new angular application with `@angular/cli@8.2.9` and combining the techniques shown in these two articles. [deploying-an-angular-universal-app-to-heroku](https://medium.com/augie-gardner/deploying-an-angular-universal-app-to-heroku-eca2b7966947) and [enable-angular-universal-for-existing-app](https://medium.com/@mafshin/enable-angular-universal-for-existing-app-3a17694b9177) plus some additional configuration to get it all working on Angular 8

## Getting Started

Download the project files and install the dependencies. this project is set up with `yarn`

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Alex61NN5/angular-universal-heroku-starter.git
$ cd angular-universal-heroku-starter
```
then run `yarn`

The `package.json` has an engines section that specifies the node and yarn version to use for the heroku build

In your terminal run the following commands
```
$ node -v
$ yarn -v // or npm -v
```
now either update your node and yarn/npm to match the ones found in the package.json or change the engines to match your versions otherwise when you try to install packages it will throw an error

```
"engines": {
    "node": "10.16.3",
    "yarn": "1.5.1"
},
```

If you wish to use `npm` instead make sure you delete the `yarn.lock` file from the project and then change the `engines` to use the version of `npm` you are running to find this out run `npm -v` an example of what this would look like is 

```
"engines": {
    "node": "10.16.3",
    "npm": "6.4.1"
},
```
**IMPORTANT**
You will probably want to change the project name so what you will need to do is do a find and replace of `angular-universal-heroku-starter` and change everything to your new project name. Most of this stuff will be in the angular.json


### Development

To run this project for development you can use the command `ng serve` or `npm start`

This project uses [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to implement git-hooks and [commitLint](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint) to check commit messages. If you do not wish to use these features remove this from your package.json

```
"husky": {
  "hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "ng lint",
    "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
  }
},
```
remove the `commitlint.config.js` file from the src directory and then run 

`yarn remove husky @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-angular`

### Test Production/Server Side Rendering

`npm run build:ssr` - Compiles your application and spins up a Node Express to serve your Universal application on http://localhost:4000

## Heroku

**IMPORTANT** For the heroku deploy to work correctly you must change this line in your package.json to match the new name of the project

`"build:client-and-server-bundles": "ng build --prod && ng run <YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>:server"`

#### To deploy to heroku

```
$ git init
$ heroku login
$ heroku create
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```

## PWA

This project is now a Progressive Web Application, this was achieved by running `ng add @angular/pwa`.

Some things to keep in mind, 
1. You will need to update the pwa icons located in the assets folder to match your application
2. You will need to update your manifest.json to reflect your application for eg.

```
{
  "name": "Your application name here",
  "short_name": "Short name for application",
  "theme_color": "#1976d2", // Colour Theme
  "background_color": "#fafafa", // Background colour
  "display": "standalone", 
  "scope": "/",
  "start_url": "/",
  ...
```
3. In the ngsw-config.json file if you plan on having a `sitemap.xml` or `robots.txt` you will need to add them to the resources section

Currently the application is getting a 92 lighthouse score, there are two issues http to https which unfortuantely is unavoidable with heroku, and the `short_name` is too long but you will need to update that anyway which will fix this issue and your score will be closer to 100
